### Hey there, I'm Mike

I author and maintain a bunch of open source projects. Programming is my profession as well as my hobby, and this profile is filled with projects that I have created in my free time. Some of them are related to - or build off - each other, but most of them are completely unrelated and represent whatever I thought it would be fun to work on at the time.

If it ever seems like I've dropped off the face of the earth, it's probably because I'm working on a private project that isn't ready to see the light of day yet. For questions about specific projects of mine, open an issue or a discussion on the relevant repo. If you have general inquiries about myself, feel free to reach out via [shadowmoo.se](https://shadowmoo.se).
